# CHEMICAL REACTIONS (3 lessons)

**3C**
- lesson 1
    - all videos explore

- lesson 2    
    - chemical change vs physic change
    - collisions model
    - how to increase reaction rate
        - T
        - Surface Area
        - concentration
    - law of conservation of mass
        - why is it conserved?
        **3E**
    - stoichiometry
    - mol to connect microscopic level with macroscopic level
        - IT ALL REVOLVES AROUND THE MOL.
        - lab: mass and volume are easy to measure
        - paper: moles are easy to work with mathematically
        **3D**

- lesson 3
    activities from the sheet (already solved)


RECAP: 
- papel quemau

- what is a chemical change?
- what happens to molecules during a reaction according to the collisions model?
    - during the collisions, if they have enough energy, bonds are broken and new ones are formed to make new products
    - ACTIVATION ENERGY EXPLAIN 4 **FALTÓ**
- how to increase the rate of a chemical reaction?
    - REACTION RATE EXPLAIN 4 **FALTÓ**
- law of conservation of mass?
    - we checked this macroscopically (lab)
    - how can we explain this microscopically?
- how did we connect the microscopic with the macro?
    - mol

- from molecules to moles in a reaction

- stoichiometry activities:
