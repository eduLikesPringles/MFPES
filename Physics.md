- context: F1, Mario Kart
- 3 / 12 (who takes pole?, GRAPH)
    - how many kms is 6000 m?
    - how many secs in a min?
    - unit conversion trick with fractions
    - 
- 5 / 12 (average speed vs instant speed)
- 6 / 12 (max and min instantaneous speeds)
    - careful! speed/time graph this time
- 7 / 12 (same)
- 8 / 12 (same)
- 9 / 12 (acceleration)
- 9 / 12 (same)
- 10 / 12 (same)
- 11 / 12 (calculation of all accelerations)
    - I don't care how much you work. I care that you work as much as you need to understand it.
    - complete some. see if you get them right. any questions will be answered next class. do as many as needed until you get two right in a row with no help.
- 12 / 12
    - speed formula
    - acceleration formula
    - mathematically, could we invent an acceleration of an acceleration? YES! WE CALL IT JERK. WE COULD WORK THAT UNTIL INFINITY. we also have snap, crackle, pop.
- back to the graph:
    - when did the car take the hardest lap?
    - where are the stright parts of the track?
    - which is the longest?
    - SCIENCE IS THIS. GOING BACK AND FORTH THROUGH THE SAME IDEA. MEASURING STUFF, PLOTTING RESULTS, VISUALIZING THEM, AND WONDERING ABOUT THE INSIGHTS AND RELEVANCE. Example: **FALTA**

    - speed of sound in different media. air 350 approx. water 1500 approx. glass 4000 approx. SPEED OF SOUND IN VACUUM?
    - speed of light in different media. air 300 000 000. water 225 000 000. glass 200 000 000. SPEED OF LIGHT IN VACUUM?
    - WHY IS THIS?
