**EXAMEN 17**
**EJERCICIOS 13**

LESSON 1:
- science bits explore videos
- law of conservation of mass + macro and micro explanations + example question
    - Activity 4
    - Activity 5 HOMEWORK

- chemical change vs physical change
    - Activity 1
- collisions model with science bits simulation
    - Science Bits Simulation
- increasing reaction rate with science bits simulation
    - Science Bits Simulation

LESSON 2:
- magic paper to remember law of conservation of mass

- stoichiometry: 
    - adjusting chemical equations 2 methods examples
    - from molecules to moles

- plasticine demo done

**I AM HERE**
- comentar fecha de examen y entrega ejercicios.
- maybe plasticine lab before. LESSON 3 INSTEAD OF 4

LESSON 3:
- what is a model? back to the collisions model: measurements + our attempt at an explanation.

- mole connection to micro and macro through M and Navogadro (diagram)
- grams to moles exercises with chemical reactions
- some more adjusting exercises
- back to law of conservation of mass: we don't multiply by stoichiometric factors!

LESSON 4:
- mole game with plasticine. (limiting reactant?)

- doubt solving and revising for the exam.

LESSON 5:
- EXAM
